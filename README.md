Operating Systems projects: modify xv6 OS and Unix commands:

## xv6 Operating system
This is a collaboration project where we modify or add new features to the xv6 Operating System. xv6 is a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system developed at MIT. It is  designed as a minimal, modernized reimplementation of the UNIX Version 6 (v6) system from the 1970s.
### Plan:
- Inter-process communication: Add shared memory enabling communication between any processes, unlike the exisiting IPC: pipe which allows communication between parent and child processes only.
- Locks: Add semaphores to improve the locking mechanism
- Signals: Add signals, ability to handle and register signals
- Threads: ?


## Implementing Unix-commands in a custom-shell program:
* custom_ls
* custom_cat
* custom_cp
* custom_grep
* custom_wc
* custom_mv
* custom_rm


## Contributions:
### xv6 Operating System:
* Locks-semaphores: Pranav Vijay Nadgir
* Signals: Krishna Karthik
* Threads: Prabhas Dhanikonda
* IPC-Message Passing: Nitish R Naik 


### Customizing unix-commands:
* Shell program, custom_wc, custom_rm: Nitish R Naik
* custom_cp, custom_mv: Pranav Nadgir
* custom_grep: Krishna Karthik
* custom_cat: Prabhas Dhanikonda
